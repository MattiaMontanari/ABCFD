These notes are associated with the release of IFISS 3.2.

There are two important code updates:
o  The grid generator for backward-facing step domain is much more flexible now.
   Step grids are now constructed by gluing together rectangular sub-blocks using
   new functions (grid_xblock.m, grid_mergeleftright.m) in the /grids/ directory. 
o  The stabTR time integrator (stabtrNS.m) has been modified to improve the
   global mass conservation. This means that unsteady flow results computed 
   using IFISS 3.2 are slightly different to those computed in IFISS 3.1.  
    
There are also two major new features:
o  A new directory /boussinesq_flow/ for solving time-dependent buoyancy driven 
   flow problems.   Type "help boussinesq_flow" for details. 
o  A new directory /ifissdemos/ which contains drivers which illustrate the scope 
   and functionality of the software. Type "help ifissdemos" for details.

The strabtrNS.m and stabtrBouss.m time integrators in the 27 May release 
are numerically unstable if the goal is to generate a steady-state solution. 
Specifically the time step is repeatedly cut back when running any flow
problem beyond a (problem-specific) critical time.  Updated versions of
strabtrNS and stabtrBouss.m are included in the second release of the package. 
The revised integrators are more stable than the original versions but 
they generate time steps that increase more slowly in the initial phase 
when solving inflow-outflow problems.
