There are three generic problems generated by the driver:
unsteady_bouss_testproblem.m. These are
1  Bottom heated cavity
2  Laterally heated cavity
3  Bottom heated backward-facing step

There are three problems discussed in the paper
%  "Howard C. Elman, Milan Mihajlovic and David J. Silvester",
%  "Fast iterative solvers for buoyancy driven flow problems",
%  "J. Computational Physics, 230, 3900--3914, 2011."
%  "http://eprints.ma.man.ac.uk/1611/"

The computational results  can be re-generated by running
batchmode('B-NS41') %% Gallium arsenide problem 4.1
batchmode('B-NS42') %% Rayleigh-Benard problem 4.2
batchmode('B-NS43') %% MIT test problem 4.3

There is one  problem discussed in the paper
%  "David Silvester, Alex Bespalov and Catherine Powell",
%  "A framework for the development of implicit solvers
%     for incompressible flow problems",
%  "Discrete and Continuous Dynamical Systems --- Series S",
%  "September 2012, to appear". 
%  "http://eprints.ma.man.ac.uk/1724/"

The computational results can be re-generated by running
batchmode('B-NS2') %% flow over heated step (section 3)
with the parameter nmax set to 5.
